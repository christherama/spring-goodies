# Spring Points of Integration
This repository encapsulates what I covered during the [Arity](http://arity.com) Learn Day on Friday, March 3, 2017. Specifically, we experimented with the following Spring features:
- `ApplicationRunner`
- `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver`
- `@ExceptionHandler`
- `HandlerInterceptorAdapter`

## Our working example
This repository contains code for a RESTful API that allows a client to upload driving data in the form of a trip. Each trip is associated with one user. Each user has a client-provided id that is unique to the client (org), but cannot be considered globally unique.

## Running the application locally
To download and run the application on your local machine, complete the following steps:

#### Clone the respository
```
$ cd path/to/your/workspace
$ git clone git@github.com:christherama/spring-goodies.git
$ cd spring-goodies
```

#### Run the application
```
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

#### View all users
Use a REST client or cURL to view all users:
```
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/users"

[{"id":"f96da254-15cd-460d-ba78-35738eddc462","orgId":"my-org","userId":"rama"}]
```

#### Add a trip
Use a REST client or cURL to add a trip:
```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Org-Id: my-org" -d '{"distance": 22.34,"duration": 1608}' "http://localhost:8080/users/rama/trips"

{"data":{"id":"8a9eb574-890d-40b4-9710-1348d40f579e","user":{"id":"f96da254-15cd-460d-ba78-35738eddc462","orgId":"my-org","userId":"rama"},"distance":22.34,"duration":1608}}
```

#### View all trips from a user
Use a REST client or cURL to add a trip:
```
$ curl -X GET -H "Org-Id: my-org" "http://localhost:8080/users/rama/trips"

{"data":[{"id":"ad3098cf-fbeb-42d7-960f-95273de234fe","user":{"id":"f96da254-15cd-460d-ba78-35738eddc462","orgId":"my-org","userId":"rama"},"distance":22.34,"duration":1608}]}
```

#### Add a user
```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Org-Id: my-org" -d '{"orgId": "my-org","userId": "yourname"}' "http://localhost:8080/users"

{data:{"id":"355f7bd9-80c3-4839-ae55-f273e7771c6f","orgId":"my-org","userId":"yourname"}}
```

## Using an `ApplicationRunner` to load initial data
You could use an *import.sql* file at the root of your classpath for initial data upon booting your application. This works if you're using Hibernate *and* Hibernate is creating your schema. However, why not exercise the logic of your application to persist entities?

To run a method at boot time, you can implement an `ApplicationRunner` and annotate it with `@Component`. Treat this just as you would any other component, autowiring any beans that you'll need at runtime. In [src/main/java/io/rama/DataLoader.java](https://github.com/christherama/spring-goodies/blob/master/src/main/java/io/rama/DataLoader.java), we use constructor autowiring to inject a `UserRepository` for saving an initial user. Notice the omission of the `@Autowired` annotation, since the component has only one constructor.

You'll see that the `DataLoader` component is annotated with `@Profile("local")`. When the "local" profile is active, the component will be loaded, and because it has implemented `ApplicationRunner`, its `run` method will be executed, thereby persisting a user. The inclusion of the `@Profile` annotation allows you to control whether or not initial data is loaded by setting the active profile accordingly.

## Resolving custom controller arguments with a `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver`
Controller methods in Spring are configured to understand certain argument types out of the box. Consider the following controller method:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/people/{id}")
public Person getThePerson(@PathVariable Long id) {
  // Implement the method (duh)
}
```

When Spring receives the request `GET /people/123`, Spring will know to call the `getThePerson` method as a result of the `@RequestMapping` annotation. But how does Spring provide a value for the `id` parameter?

Spring ships with built-in classes that implement the `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver` interface. This interface defines how controller methods resolve values for their defined parameters. For example, Spring uses the [PathVariableArgumentResolver](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/annotation/PathVariableMethodArgumentResolver.html) to pass a value into any parameter annotated with `@PathVariable`.

To see which parameter types Spring supports out of the box, see the [supported method argument types](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-ann-arguments).

In our application, let's say we want to tell Spring how to resolve a `User` argument, with the `orgId` provided as a request header, and the `userId` provided as a path parameter. If we are going to be doing this across many methods in our API, we might find it convenient to consolidate this logic into a single `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver`.

See [src/main/java/io/rama/web/request/UserHandlerMethodArgumentResolver.java](https://github.com/christherama/spring-goodies/blob/master/src/main/java/io/rama/web/request/UserHandlerMethodArgumentResolver.java) as an example.

Overall, you'll implement the `supportsParameter` method to return `true` when you want Spring to use a given `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver` to resolve a controller method argument. Then, you'll implement the `resolveArgument` method so that it returns the value that you want to pass into the controller method.

If you define a custom resolver, don't forget to tell Spring about it via a `WebMvcConfigurerAdapter` that's been annotated with `@Configuration`. As an example, see [src/main/java/io/rama/config/WebConfig.java](https://github.com/christherama/spring-goodies/blob/master/src/main/java/io/rama/config/WebConfig.java#L20).

## Handling application exceptions with `@ExceptionHandler` methods
When a request is made to a Spring REST API, if an exception is thrown and not caught by the time the controller method returns a value, a JSON-serialized response might look like this:

```javascript
{
  "timestamp": 1490895457664,
  "status": 500,
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "exception": "io.rama.user.UserNotFoundException",
  "message": "User with id 'chris' not found",
  "path": "/users/chris/trips"
}
```

A more intentional error response resulting from an exception might look like this:

```javascript
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User with id 'chris' not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

Spring offers the `@ExceptionHandler` as a convenient way to "catch" exceptions thrown by a controller or downstream call. Simply create a method annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` and specify the type of exception you want your method to handle, returning the object whose serialized value you'd like to use for the response. If you want to keep your exception handlers in a separate class, be sure to annotate the class with `@RestControllerAdvice`. Otherwise, the exception handler methods will apply to any request handled by the controller in which the exception handler methods exist.

See [src/main/java/io/rama/web/ExceptionController.java](https://github.com/christherama/spring-goodies/blob/master/src/main/java/io/rama/web/ExceptionController.java) as an example.

Be sure to leverage your inheritance hierarchy for consistently handling families of exceptions. For example, if you have a `UserNotFoundException` and `TripNotFoundException` in your application, you could have them both subclass a `ResourceNotFoundException`, and write your exception handler accordingly:

```java
@ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public Response notFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
  // Do some stuff and return a thing
}
```
